### Status

Very early, but this is what we use live on [byte.co](http://byte.co). 

Here's a quick list of what's left to do:

- `Music` object
- Sound on `Video` objects
- `"fireworks"` motion effect
- Unit tests

And some things that could be improved:

- Text rendering is not 1:1 with the iOS and OS X clients. Namely:
  - The `Text` object has different word wrap rules when `word-wrap` is set to `auto`
  - Scaling of `Text` objects behaves differently in some scenarios (usually when clamped vertically)
  - The `Paragraph` object has slightly different vertical align and line height behavior
- `Link` objects have slightly different rendering than native clients, causing minor overlaps in some cases
