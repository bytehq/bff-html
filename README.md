Byte rendering implemented in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Canvas.

### Status

Very early. Here's a quick list of what's left to do:

- `Music` object
- Sound on `Video` objects
- Color fills on `Graphic` objects
- Text rendering for `Text` and `Paragraph` is missing several fonts and behaves oddly in certain scenarios
- ~~Opacity for all objects~~
- Effects for all objects
- Unit tests
- Retina support for Canvas elements (currently only `Text`)
